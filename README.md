For our last project of Type and Interaction 1, I created a holistic website that allows you to navigate three texts: Italic Not Italic, A Note on the Type, and Typeface as Programme. Through my thoughtful designs, I empower the reader to immerse themselves in the readings and see how typography can shape their world view.
