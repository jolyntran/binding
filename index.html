					<p>Typography isn’t just about <mark>aesthetics;</mark> it’s an adaptable and dynamic force that reacts to its environment. These readings explore how type interacts with <mark>culture, technology, and design</mark> to communicate ideas, challenge conventions, and evolve over time. From dissecting the tension between italic and roman styles to questioning the rules that dictate type design today, these texts invite us to explore the power of type as a programmable system, a tool for storytelling, and a medium of endless possibilities. Together, they ask: <mark>How can typography shape how we see, feel, and interact with the world around us?</mark></p>
